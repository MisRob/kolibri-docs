Kolibri Android App runs as a standalone app on phone and tablet mobile devices. It has similar features and functionalities as Kolibri installed on desktop and laptop devices, but you must keep in mind its limitations, especially regarding the storage capacity and the amount of content channels and resources you will be able to import in your Android device.

You will need Internet access or a data plan on your mobile device to download Kolibri Android App and import learning resources, but no Internet or data is required thereafter to use the Kolibri Android App.

Compatibility
-------------

Android version 5.0 and higher.


Storage requirements
--------------------

Storage occupied by Kolibri content will depend on the amount and type of resources you decide to import. Video resources will in general occupy much more storage space and take longer to import compared to exercises and resources in HTML format. Check the **Settings > Storage** on your device to see how much internal space you have available to import on your device.
