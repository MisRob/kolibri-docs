Assign Additional Permissions
-----------------------------

By default, only **Superusers** can view the **Device** dashboard, import/export **Content** channels in Kolibri, and modify **Permissions** for other users. However, depending on the needs of the institution, **Superusers** can also :ref:`grant these permissions <permissions>` to other users.
