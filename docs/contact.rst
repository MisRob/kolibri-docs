`Community Forums <https://community.learningequality.org/>`_.

Once you register on our forums, please read the the first two pinned topics

You can add a new topic with the **+ New Topic** button on the right. Make sure
to select the **Kolibri** category in the **Create a New Topic** window so it’s
easier to classify and respond to.
