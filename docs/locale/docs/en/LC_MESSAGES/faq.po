"``0.0.0.0`` = A special IP address on the **server** (your device running"
" Kolibri and \"serving\" its content to others in the local network), "
"which actually means \"all available IP addresses\". It's a kind of "
"alias. But accessing ``0.0.0.0`` from another computer doesn't make sense"
" and doesn't work. By default, Kolibri will serve on ``0.0.0.0``, which "
"essentially means all IP addresses that are available on the device will "
"render Kolibri accessible."

"``127.0.0.1`` = A device's local IP address, meaning \"myself\". Some "
"people joke and say \"There's no place like 127.0.0.1\", meaning "
"\"there's no place like home\" :) This can be used on the serving device "
"itself to test that Kolibri is running, in case you need a failsafe way "
"of checking that Kolibri is in fact running and responsive."

"``192.x.y.z`` = Addresses starting with ``192`` are local network IP "
"addresses. The same thing can be said about ``10.x.y.z``. The address "
"that you wanna use to enter on the clients/tablets in order to contact "
"the server will in most cases start with ``192`` or ``10``."

"Port number: Kolibri runs on port ``8080``. When you access something on "
"an IP address, you need a port. Ports can be open or closed on the "
"server, but they can also be regulated by firewall rules on the way. "
"``http://`` <- this is the protocol that the browser reads out from the "
"\"URL\", which is just some text that describes Kolibri."
