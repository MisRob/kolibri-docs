msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:8
msgid ""
"It is FREE – both free as in “free speech” and free as in “free beer”! To"

msgid "Do I need the internet to run Kolibri?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:14
msgid ""
"Short answer: **No!** You can bring or send a storage device (USB or HDD "
"unit) with Kolibri installer and content channels downloaded somewhere "
"with available internet connection, and install everything on an "
"completely offline device."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:16
msgid ""
"In a nutshell, Kolibri can run independently of internet availability, "
"but you need to procure the installer and content channels from somewhere"
" for the initial installation and for subsequent upgrades."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:18
msgid ""
"One possibility is to have Kolibri installed in one location with "
"internet connection, where you can import content channels from `Kolibri "
"Studio <https://studio.learningequality.org/>`_ (curriculum tool and "
"content curation server), and then export them to removable USB drives "
"that you bring or send to offline locations (rural schools, refugee "
"camps, etc.) to import locally."

"School with no existing computer lab: For schools that do not have an "
