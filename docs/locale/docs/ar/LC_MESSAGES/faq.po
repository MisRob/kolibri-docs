msgid "How much does Kolibri cost to install?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:20
msgid "It is FREE – both free as in “free speech” and free as in “free beer”! To learn more about free software, see this `Free Software Foundation article <http://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software>`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:24
msgid "Do I need the internet to run Kolibri?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:26
msgid "Short answer: **No!** You can bring or send a storage device (USB or HDD unit) with Kolibri installer and content channels downloaded somewhere with available internet connection, and install everything on an completely offline device."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:28
msgid "In a nutshell, Kolibri can run independently of internet availability, but you need to procure the installer and content channels from somewhere for the initial installation and for subsequent upgrades."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:30
msgid "One possibility is to have Kolibri installed in one location with internet connection, where you can import content channels from `Kolibri Studio <https://studio.learningequality.org/>`_ (curriculum tool and content curation server), and then export them to removable USB drives that you bring or send to offline locations (rural schools, refugee camps, etc.) to import locally."

msgid "What are the typical deployment scenarios?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:65
msgid "There is no typical deployment scenario. However, we can share with you what we’ve learned from our community of KA Lite and Kolibri users. A typical school deployment varies depending on whether or not a school already has a computer lab."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:67
msgid "School with an existing computer lab: In this case, Kolibri would be deployed as a server on one of the existing computers. Students would connect using client devices over the local network."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:68
msgid "School with no existing computer lab: For schools that do not have an existing computer lab, a Kolibri deployment would involve obtaining a device that can run as a Kolibri server (most computers) and other devices to be used as clients. One common configuration is using a Raspberry Pi or other inexpensive computer as a server and relatively cheap tablets as client devices."

msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:74
msgid "To deploy Kolibri for multiple users you will need:"

msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:77
msgid "One or more **client devices** that have web browsers (laptops, tablets, desktop computers, etc)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:80
msgid "For a single-device deployment (1) and (2) can be the same computer, with the browser connecting to the locally running Kolibri server. To make the software accessible to multiple client devices, you will need to put them on the same local network as the Kolibri server device (1), e.g. through a WIFI access point."
