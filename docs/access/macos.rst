#. **The first time you start the Kolibri application, do NOT use Launchpad**. Instead use the **Finder** on your Mac to locate Kolibri in the **Applications** folder. This is because the application is unsigned and needs your permission to run.

#. Control-click the app icon, then choose **Open** from the shortcut menu.
  
   After completing these steps, your security settings are updated for this version of Kolibri, and you can launch Kolibri like any other application. You may need to repeat this process when you upgrade Kolibri.
