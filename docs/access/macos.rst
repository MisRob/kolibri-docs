#. **Kolibri app is not yet sighed, so the first time you start it, do NOT use Launchpad**. Instead use the **Finder** on your Mac to locate Kolibri app in the **Applications** folder.

#. Control-click the app icon, then choose **Open** from the shortcut menu.
  
   This step will be saved as an exception to your security settings, so you are able to open Kolibri in the future by double-clicking it just as you would do with other apps.
