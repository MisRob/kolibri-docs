Coach
=====

You can track progress of the **Learner** users, create and assign **Exams** to classes or learner groups from the **Coach** dashboard. The default view of the **Coach** dashboard presents the list of **Classes** with number of learners enrolled to each class.

Select a class from the list to access the progress-tracking features and create exams.
